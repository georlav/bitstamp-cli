New pairs are constantly added so if you notice that a pair is missing you can run the following command and open pr

```bash
go generate ./...
```

This fetches all supported pairs from bitstamp and generates new pair and channel enums.

## Private functions and configuration
To be able to use private functions you need to generate an API key and a secret using your bitstamp account. To do that you need to visit.

Profile settings -> API access -> New API key

You can pass those to the client using the following functional options
```go
c := bitstamp.NewHTTPAPI(
	bitstamp.APIKeyOption("yourkey"),
	bitstamp.APISecretOption("yoursecret"),
)
```

Or you can set them as environmental variables and client will automatically read them
```bash
export BITSTAMP_KEY="yourkey"
export BITSTAMP_SECRET="yoursecret"
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Environmental variables override functional options.

## Running tests
To run the integration tests for public functions use
```go
go test ./... -v -race -short
```

To run all integration tests and cover also private functions you need to set your secret and key at your env and run test without -short
```go
go test ./... -v -race
```
